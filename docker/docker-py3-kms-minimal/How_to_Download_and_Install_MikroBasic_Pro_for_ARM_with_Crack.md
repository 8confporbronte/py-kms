1. Go to [this link](https://downloaddevtools.com/en/product/2727/download-mikroelektronika-mikrobasic-pro-for-arm) and click on the "Download" button. You will get a ZIP file containing the setup file and the crack file[^1^].
2. Extract the ZIP file and run the setup file. Follow the installation wizard and choose the default options. When the installation is finished, do not run the compiler yet.
3. Copy the crack file (mikroBasic PRO ARM.exe) and paste it into the installation folder (usually C:\Program Files (x86)\Mikroelektronika\mikroBasic PRO ARM). Replace the original file when prompted.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed MikroBasic Pro for ARM with crack. You can now run the compiler and enjoy its features. However, please note that this is an illegal and unethical way of using the software. If you like the compiler and want to support its development, you should buy a license from [the official website](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobasic-arm). You will get lifetime free updates, technical support, and access to more libraries and examples[^2^].
  
## Why Choose MikroBasic Pro for ARM?
 
MikroBasic Pro for ARM is a great choice for beginners and professionals alike who want to develop applications for ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. Here are some of the reasons why you should choose this compiler:

- It is based on the popular Basic programming language, which has a simple syntax and clear code. You can easily learn the language and start writing your own programs in no time.
- It has a powerful and user-friendly IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that provides all the tools you need to write, compile, debug, and test your code. You can also customize the IDE to suit your preferences and needs.
- It has native support for hardware step-by-step In-Circuit Debugger when used with fast USB 2.0 mikroProg programmer or Stellaris debuggers. You can monitor your program execution on the hardware level, set breakpoints, watch variables, modify registers, and more.
- It has an integrated Visual TFT tool that allows you to create amazing user interfaces by dragging and dropping graphic elements. The compiler generates the code automatically in the background, and you can modify it in the IDE and create event functions.
- It has a Single Static Assignment optimization that can shrink your code to even smaller size. This can help you save memory space and improve performance.
- It has Active Comments that enable you to make your comments alive and interactive. You can insert images, links, tables, charts, formulas, and more into your comments.

## How to Use MikroBasic Pro for ARM?
 
MikroBasic Pro for ARM is easy to use and has a lot of features that can help you develop your applications faster and better. Here are some tips on how to use the compiler effectively:

- Use the Project Manager to create and organize your projects. You can add files, folders, libraries, resources, and settings to your project.
- Use the Library Manager to browse and manage the built-in and third-party libraries. You can also download new libraries from LibStock or create your own libraries.
- Use the Code Assistant to get suggestions and hints while writing your code. You can also use the Wild Card Code Completion to insert code snippets with placeholders.
- Use the Interrupt Assistant to generate interrupt service routines for various events. You can also use the Quick Converter to convert values between different formats.
- Use the Code Explorer to monitor your program structure, variables, and functions. You can also use the Statistics tool to get detailed reports and graphs on your code.
- Use the Hardware Debugger or Software Simulator to debug your code on the target device or on your PC. You can also use the UART Terminal, UDP Terminal, HID Terminal, or ASCII Chart tools to communicate with your device.
